				<p class="content-header">Student Housing</p>
				<img src="images/housing.jpg" width="100%">
				<p>
					SUTD's staff and student housing blocks are conveniently located on the SUTD campus, just a stone's
					throw away from the academic blocks and sports facilities. It usually takes residents just 10
					minutes to get to class from their rooms!

					Freshmore undergraduates are required to reside at student housing, specifically in double rooms.
					Designed to promote interaction and collaboration, residential living aims to foster a sense of
					community and ownership, and build strong friendships starting from the students’ very first year,
					where classmates are grouped into clusters in the housing blocks.
				</p>
				<img src="images/sutd_room.jpg" width="100%">
				<p class="content-bolder">Group Study Room</p>
				<p>Each block also has group study rooms, each outfitted with clusters of tables for students who prefer
					to study in groups. These rooms are made for smaller study groups, though they can also be used for
					discussions.</p>
				<p class="content-bolder">Recreational Room</p>
				<p>Not all the common spaces in Hostel are for studies of course. Each block has two recreational rooms,
					fitted with a TV screen and beanbags where residents can just relax after a long day of studying.
				</p>
				<p class="content-bolder">Hostel Lounge</p>
				<p>
					The hostel lounge is a common space for residents to use, with a board game
					collection of award winning titles that are available for loan, residents are welcomed to
					visit the lounge and relax with some fun board games. There are even boards in the hostel lounge
					that residents can write on using whiteboard markers, facilitating discussions.
				</p>
				<p class="content-bolder">Backspace</p>
				<p>
					At the back of Block 55, there is another open-air recreational space for the residents, aptly named
					Backspace. This open space has been outfitted with tables and chairs, and groups of residents often
					make it one of their supper locations at night, especially when there’s a nice cool breeze!
				</p>
				<p class="content-bolder">Music Room</p>
				<p>
					Part of the Backspace includes a music room for students to jam in. A soundproof air-conditioned
					room that is open to residents 24/7, the music room is commonly used by students who want to
					practise and have a jam session together without disturbing the other residents.
